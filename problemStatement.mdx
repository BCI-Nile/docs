description: 'Empowering Independence for Individuals with Motor Impairments'
---




Our goal is to revolutionize the lives of individuals with severe muscular disorders or paralysis by providing them with a means to regain independence and autonomy. 
We aim to create assistive technologies that cater to people with complete motor impairments, enabling them to perform tasks without relying on physical controls or constant caregiver assistance. 
By doing so, we hope to improve their overall quality of life, reduce social isolation, and alleviate psychological stress. 
Moreover, we strive to alleviate the burden on caregivers, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks and fostering a more balanced care dynamic.
