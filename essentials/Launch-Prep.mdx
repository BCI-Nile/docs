To ensure a successful launch, address any last-minute technical, operational, or market issues affecting the BCI system.
Manufacturing & Supply Chain Finalization: Confirm that hardware components (if applicable) are prepared for production and distribution.
Support Systems Setup: Implement customer support channels, FAQs, and maintenance plans for users.
Stress Testing: Conduct final stress tests on the system to verify its ability to handle a large number of users, particularly for cloud-based or SaaS BCI platforms.
