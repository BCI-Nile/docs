NeurosynBCI interprets brain activity using EEG signals collected via a wireless headset. 
The signals are processed in real time to control the movement of a robotic wheelchair, allowing the user complete mobility without the need for physical input. Unlike other solutions that may necessitate invasive brain surgery or rely on physical controls, NeurosynBCI is both non-invasive and wireless. The headset is lightweight and comfortable, built for long-term use, and works seamlessly with the wheelchair via Bluetooth. The headset uses high EEG sensitivity to detect even subtle brain signals. By combining high EEG sensitivity with advanced robotics, 
NeurosynBCI provides a unique and accessible solution to mobility issues.
