About 16% of the world's population experience disability, millions of whom suffer from conditions that limit their mobility. The global assistive technology market is rapidly growing, leading to increased demand for mobility solutions among the elderly and people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. This emphasizes the need for advanced assistive devices that allow people to maintain their independence.

However, current solutions such as traditional powered wheelchairs still require some amount of physical control, whether through a joystick or other manual input. This makes them inaccessible to individuals with severe paralysis or degenerative diseases, thereby still requiring caregiver participation.

Furthermore, the societal costs of full-time caregivers are major, both financially and emotionally. Many people with severe mobility impairments rely entirely on caregivers for even the most basic tasks, putting pressure on both the individuals and their families. Caregivers frequently experience burnout, and healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to support a growing population of people with long-term disabilities.

With advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, new opportunities, particularly non-invasive solutions, are available to improve mobility and independence for those who have no other options.

The demand for assistive technologies is increasing as the global population ages, which makes this the right time for solutions like NeurosyncBCI to increase the quality of life for millions of individuals.
