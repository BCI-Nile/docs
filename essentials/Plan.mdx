Our implementation plan includes finalizing the BCI systemâ€™s core functionality, 
ensuring it performs well in key areas like EEG signal interpretation, imagined speech recognition, robotic control, and emotional analysis.

So far, NeuroSync has made significant progress in BCI technology, integrating an EEG headset that enables thought-driven control of devices. 
We developed a robot car that moves based on users' mental commands and trained a machine learning model using data from 20 users for signal interpretation.
We now aim to make improvements as follows:
