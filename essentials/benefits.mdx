Our solution improves users quality of life by giving them the ability to move their wheelchairs just by thinking,
an improvement will be made to integrate an LCD screen where users will be able to covertly speak and decoded speech will be interpreted on screen,
so as to give back them the ability to communicate with loved ones once again, also increase independence and reduce caregiver reliance.

The system is comfortable due to it being non-invasive i.e it does not require surgery, 
patients will be skeptical on planting a chip in the brain, as such our solution addresses the issue of surgery. Furthermore, 
Our solution has a wireless EEG headset whereas other existing solutions offer a wired headset. 
The BCI system, through EEG signal processing, offers real-time control over wheelchair movement. 
This allows for smoother navigation and quicker responses, in terms of paralyzed patients who cannot move, 
the traditional manual or joystick-controlled systems will not be efficient.

This newfound autonomy offers long-term benefits by increasing users' independence and improving their mental well-being, 
as it allows them to control their mobility with ease and autonomy. 
This reduces frustration and fosters confidence, enabling users to participate more actively in social and professional activities. 
For families and caregivers, the system alleviates physical and emotional strain, allowing them to focus on personal activities while reducing the need for full-time care. 
Financially, the system can lead to cost savings by minimizing medical expenses and reliance on caregivers.
 Overall, it opens up greater life opportunities for users, enhancing their quality of life and long-term prospects.

Aside mobility use, our system offers healthcare providers and rehabilitation centers several additional benefits, 
including improved patient monitoring through continuous tracking of brain activity, which allows for more personalized treatment adjustments. 
It enhances training opportunities for healthcare professionals to develop expertise in cutting-edge technology and contributes to research efforts in neurology and rehabilitation. 
The system can also boost patient satisfaction by providing more autonomous mobility solutions, leading to better outcomes and retention. 
Furthermore, it allows facilities to expand their service offerings, attracting a broader range of patients seeking specialized neurorehabilitation care.
